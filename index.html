            <div class="description">Arctic Freezer is a visionary project blending art and environmental advocacy. Its centerpiece is a piece of Arctic ice, encapsulated in a glass bell, symbolizing the fragility of Earth's ecosystems. Inside the ice is a unique artifact: a human ear made from biodegradable collagen, containing DNA-encoded manifest for Earth. This represents the need to listen and respond to our planet's urgent messages.
                <br>
                The project's hardware ingeniously keeps the ice perpetually frozen, mirroring the challenge of preserving our changing world. Arctic Freezer serves as a stark reminder and an educational tool, urging viewers to reflect on their relationship with nature and advocate for sustainability and conservation. This exhibit is not just visually striking, but carries a profound message, emphasizing the importance of protecting our planet.</div>
